		Literals

(1)Integral

-> Integer

Integer Literal  
		-> Decimal  -> Base -10  (0 - 9)
			int x = 10;
		
		-> Octal	-> Base - 7 (0 - 7)
			int x = 010;
		
		-> HexaDecimal		-> Base - 16 (0 - 9)(a - f)
			int x = 0x10;
		


-> Floating point
		1. It only accept decimal values as floating point.
			example  -> double x = 2.75;
					 -> float f = 235.55;
				
		2. Scientific notation is allowed.
			example  -> double d = 2.7e5;
				     -> float f = 12.03e2f;
				
		3. Integers values can be stored in floating point.
			example  -> double d  = 10;  (1110.0)
			
		4. Floating point values is not stored in octal, hexadecimal and binary format.

			 					STRING
			 
			 
			 
String : It's a combination or two or more characters when enclosed in double quotes.
		 It is a user defined data type (Non primitive).
		 It is an in-built class.
		 is is stored in lang package.
		 They are immutable(Unchangeable) in nature .
		 There are two ways to declare String in java.
		 	-> using "" -> this type of string gets string in constant pool.
		 	-> Using new keyword -> This type of string is stored in non-constant pool.
		 	
		 	
		Duplicate data will not be created in constant pool.
		Duplication of data is allowed in non-constant pool.
		 	
		 	
		 	Methods of a String
		 	
		 	-> length() : Finds the length of a given String
		 	-> charAt() : Extracts character from a given String
		 	-> toUppercase() : Converts all changes to uppercase
		 	-> toLowercase() : Converts all changes to lowercase
		 	-> equals() : Check if both string objects are same or not. Return True or False
		 	-> compareTo() : Check if both the string object are same or not . Return +ve, -ve or 0 value
		 	-> toCharArray() : Converts string to character array.
		 	-> equalIgnoreCase() : Check if both the string object are same or not. Return true or false[it ignore case]
		 	-> isAlphabet() : Check if an entered character is Alphabet or not.
		 	-> split() : Split the given string. 
		 	-> isDigit() : Check if there is a digit is present or not.
		 	-> Integer.parseInt() : To convert String into integer 
		 	-> String.ValueOf() : To convert integer to String
		 	-> append() : Increase the size of String(2*n+2) n -> original size	
		 	-> insert(0 , 0) -> Insert a particular character AT an index
		 	-> substring(0 , 0) -> find a particular sub String of a given index {pointer kabhi bhi phiche nhi ayega}
		 	-> subsequence() -> Does not allow repeated values		{isme pointer phivhe aa sakata haa}	(2*n+1)
		 	
		 	
		 	
		Constructor
		 	
		 	-> Default constructor 
		 	-> Parameterised constructor
		 	
		 	
		 Rules for defining a constructor
		 	
		 	-> They are speliced methods whose name must be same as class name.
		 	-> They does not support return type.
		 	-> They are by default public/default.
		 	 
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
	Types of variable : 
				
				-> There are three types of variablre in java :
				  -> local variable
				  -> Instance Variable
				  -> Static variable
				  
		-> Local Variable :: They are those variable which is present inside aye method (User defined/local variable)
							 They must be initialized
		
		-> Instance variable :: They are those variable which is present inside a class outside the methods.
								Default values are considered for instance variable.
								It has the highest priority.
								
		-> Static variable :: They are the variable which is present inside the class outside the method with a keyword "static".
							  Default values are considered for instance variable.
		 	
		 	Whenever there is a  name clash between Instance variable and constructor parameter compiler considers the default or the priority value of instance variable.
		 	To resolve such problem and increase the readability of the code we use "this" key word.  
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	Inheritance : 
		 			-> It's a fundamental OOP's concept which states one class ininheriting the properties of one class into another class 
		 			-> The class form which properties and Baheviour will be inherit is known as parent class, Super class, Base class  
		 			-> The class that will inherit and behaviour is known as child class, sub class ,
		 			-> We can inherit the properties and behaviours using "extends" Keyword
		 			-> Inheritance is "is-a" relation.
		 			
		 			-> Inheriting behaviour 
		 			
		 			  
		 			Q -> Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in java ?
		 			
		 				When we try to inherit the property or behaviour of two or more parent class inside a child class compliler gets confused (it rais to ambigudide problem) because whose property or behavous has to be inherited first
		 				This problem can be resolved using abstract class or inter-face
		 			
		 			Types of Inheritance :
		 						-> Single Inheritance
		 						-> Multilevel Inheritance
		 						-> Hybrid Inheritance
		 						-> Hierarchical Inheritance
		 			
		 			
		 			
		 			
		 			
		 			
		 			
		 			
		 	Method overriding : 
		 			-> It means methods having same name but change in implementation 
		 			-> It can be achived through inheritance only.
		 			
		 	
		 	
		 	Polymorphism : 
		 			-> Their are two types of polymorphism compile time polymorphism (method overloading) rum time polymorphism (method overriding) 
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	
		 	DSA : 
		 	
		 		Array : 
		 				Array is a linera data structure which constuites homogeneous elements in a contineous manner.
		 				
		 				for(data_type variable name : character name)
		 				
		 				
		 				mid point formula : mid = (start + end) / 2;                jaha sirf eak bar nikalna hoo
		 									mid = (start + (end - start)) / 2;      jaha bar bar mid point change hoo
			 	
		 	Delecration of 2D array : int[][] x;
		 							  int [][]x;
		 							  int x[][];
		 							  int[] []x;
		 							  int []x[];
		 							  int[] x[];
